    "I am interpreting the regression outputs for models analyzing the influence of marijuana legalization (Legalized), political party affiliation (Party), alcohol consumption (Alcohol), and tobacco use (Tobacco) on depression and anxiety levels in May-Jun 2021. For depression, the model suggests a non-statistically significant slight increase in scores with marijuana legalization (coefficient = 0.027337, p-value = 0.4624) and a minor decrease associated with political party affiliation (coefficient = -0.041256, p-value = 0.2912). At the same time, alcohol consumption shows a small but significant decrease in depression scores (coefficient = -0.007826, p-value = 0.0102), and tobacco use indicates a non-significant slight increase (coefficient = 0.004841, p-value = 0.2494). The model accounts for approximately 20.87% of the variance in depression scores, with an adjusted R-squared of 0.1399, and is overall statistically significant (F-statistic p-value = 0.0266). For anxiety, the findings are similar. Marijuana legalization is associated with a non-significant slight increase in anxiety scores (coefficient = 0.051770, p-value = 0.20167), political party affiliation with a non-significant minor decrease (coefficient = -0.040007, p-value = 0.34425), alcohol consumption with a significant decrease (coefficient = -0.010208, p-value = 0.00232), and tobacco use with a non-significant negligible decrease (coefficient = -0.001418, p-value = 0.75381). This model explains about 22.75% of the variance in anxiety scores (Multiple R-squared = 0.2275), with an adjusted R-squared of 0.1603, and is statistically significant (F-statistic p-value = 0.01646). Both models underscore alcohol consumption's significant association with lower depression and anxiety levels, though effect sizes are modest. In contrast, the legalization of marijuana, political party affiliation, and tobacco use do not show statistically significant impacts on depression or anxiety. I am not sure what else to write here."
